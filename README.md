# Overview

My name is Ethan Seegmiller. I am a young software developer, and this is my project! As a fun challenge for myself, I decided to learn how to program a video game from the ground up! I decided that, in order to learn how to build a video game for the first time, it would be easiest for me to recreate a game that already exists, is simple in design and gameplay, and could be built in a language that I already knew. To cater to these learning needs, I chose to reacreate the fan-favorite arcade game, "Space Invaders"!

The game that I have programmed here is a recreation of the timeless arcade classic, "Space Invaders". I have recreated the game fairly faithfully to the original, but have added just enough twists to make it my own, thus creating something new: "Ethan's Alien Invaders"! The goal of the game is to use your tank to shoot down the incoming alien spaceships before they get you. The aliens slowly progress towards the bottom of the screen, and shoot back at you. Once they reach the bottom, or hit you with a laser, it's game over. Use the "<--"" and "-->"" arrow keys to move left and right, and the "SPACE" bar to fire your laser cannon. Try and see how many aliens you can shoot down before they reach their goal! Have fun! 

As a software engineer, who is constantly on the lookout for new and exciting learning opportunities, I took on this challenge to further my coding knowledge and learn how to do something I've never done before. I've always enjoyed video games, especially simple arcade-style ones that are easy to learn and fun to master. I've also always been fascinated by game development and the process that goes on behind a video game's creation. I had never built a video game before, and wanted to learn how it could be done and build a simple game of my own!

# Development Environment

To create my game, I decied to use VS Code to write the actual code. I also used Git and GitHub for version control and to keep track of changes I made to my code throughout the development process of this game.

For this challenge, I knew I had to start small and easy, since this was my first go and creating a game. I decided to use a coding language that I was already familiar with, namely Python, so that I wouldn't have the added stress of learning a new language. I mainly focused on learning the basic principles and process of game design and applied them to Python. There are many ways to make a game with Python, including the Arcade tool, and the Pygame library for Python; however, I decided to use a tool called Turtle, which allows for simple games and animations to be made in Python easily, with little hassle.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Add music and sound effects for a more immersive experience
* Fix movement of the tank and aliens to be less clunky
* Have aliens speed up more as you shoot them to increase difficulty
* Fix the score graphic so that the aliens don't cover it up when they pass over it.
* Come up with a more interesting and rewarding scoring system.

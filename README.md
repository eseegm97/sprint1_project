# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description the game that you wrote. Describe how to play your game.}
Welcome to my game! The game that I have programmed here is a recreation of the timeless arcade classic, Space Invaders. I have recreated the game fairly faithfully to the original, but have added just enough twists to make it my own, thus creating something new: "Ethan's Alien Invaders"! The goal of the game is to use your tank to shoot down the incoming alien spaceships before they get you. The aliens slowly progress towards the bottom of the screen, and once they touch the bottom, it's game over. Use the "<--"" and "-->"" arrow keys to move left and right, and the "SPACE" bar to fire your laser cannon. Try and see how many aliens you can shoot down before they reach their goal! Have fun! 

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}
